# Machine_Learning
In a project that uses NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, these libraries would be used in different stages of the project. For example, NumPy would be used for numerical computations, Pandas for data manipulation and preparation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Seaborn for more advanced visualization techniques.
